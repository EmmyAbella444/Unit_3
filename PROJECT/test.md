# Unit 3: A Distributed Weather Station for ISAK

# Criteria A: Planning


## Problem definition
Sabuhi, a first-year International Baccalaureate (IB) student at UWC ISAK Japan, has a jam-packed schedule that has made it challenging for him to have productive days and maintain a consistent routine. Despite his best efforts, he has been struggling to stay on track with his daily habits. As a result, Sabuhi is searching for a solution to help him monitor his habits and improve his overall lifestyle.

## Proposed Solution
Recognizing the difficulties Sabuhi has been facing with productivity and habit tracking I decided to create an Habit Tracker. This tracker will allow Sabuhi to log his daily activities, monitor his progress, and track his habits to ensure that he stays on track with his goals.

The Habit Tracker will be tailored to Sabuhi's needs and will be designed to help him focus on the areas that require improvement. By using this tool, Sabuhi can identify which habits are hindering his productivity and which ones are helping him achieve his goals. Additionally, the Habit Tracker will provide a notes session for each day to allow him reflect on his day.

Overall, the Habit Tracker will serve as an effective solution to Sabuhi's habit tracking needs, providing him with a tool to help him stay on track with his goals and improve his lifestyle.
